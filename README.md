## ðŸ§  About Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a **zero-player game** that simulates cell evolution on a grid. Each cell follows these simple rules:

- A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors **survives**
- A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors **comes to life**
- All other cells **die or remain dead**

This project simulates and displays the evolution visually and verifies patterns through automated tests.
